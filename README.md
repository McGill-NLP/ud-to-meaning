The files in `/conllus` all come from [the GUM corpus](http://universal.grew.fr/?corpus=UD_English-GUM@2.10), some of them subsequently edited by me.

The version of Python's [NLTK DRT module](https://www.nltk.org/howto/drt.html) used here is slightly modified, which was done to prevent certain variable clashes during beta-reduction. I have included the modified file as `drt-MODIFIED.py` in this repository. The only change is an insertion at what once was line 976 of the original `drt.py`: lines 976-994 of `drt-MODIFIED.py` are my own doing.

The version of Counter (Rik van Noord, Lasha Abzianidze, Hessel Haagsma, and Johan Bos. **Evaluating scoped meaning representations**. LREC 2018 [\[PDF\]](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/L18-1267.pdf)) used here is also slightly modified. This is to facilitate integrating it into a larger Python program. I have included the modified file as `counder-MODIFIED.py` in this repository. Note that Counter is distributed under the [MIT license](https://mit-license.org/).
